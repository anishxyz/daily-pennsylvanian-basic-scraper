# Robots Analysis for the Daily Pennsylvanian

The Daily Pennsylvanian's `robots.txt` file is available at
[https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt](https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt).

## Contents of the `robots.txt` file on February 27, 2025

```
User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /
```

## Explanation

This robots.txt file contains two rule sets:

1. The first rule set applies to all web crawlers/bots (`User-agent: *`):
   - `Crawl-delay: 10`: All bots should wait at least 10 seconds between consecutive requests to the server. This helps prevent overloading the server.
   - `Allow: /`: All bots are explicitly allowed to crawl the entire website. This is actually redundant, as allowing access is the default behavior if no `Disallow` directive is specified.

2. The second rule set applies specifically to SemrushBot (an SEO analysis tool):
   - `Disallow: /`: SemrushBot is not allowed to crawl any part of the website.
